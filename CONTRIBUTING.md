# Contributing

## Baseline

- Use Node.js 24 LTS (24.15.0 or newer in the 24.x line) for development, builds, and CI
- Use `pnpm@12.8.1`, as pinned in the root `package.json`
- Preserve the published packages' runtime requirement: `^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0`
- Keep published packages ESM-only
- Keep published library packages on `tsdown` + `rolldown`

The development Node.js minimum follows the ESLint toolchain supplied by repoctl. Shared repository tooling is configured through `repoctl.config.ts` and the `repoctl/tooling` wrappers. Dependency catalogs, overrides, and installation settings live in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`; `.npmrc` contains registry and authentication settings.

## Before Opening A PR

- Run `pnpm run guard:migration`
- Run `pnpm run typecheck:fast` while iterating (optional, faster local feedback)
- Run `pnpm typecheck`
- Run `pnpm lint`
- Run `pnpm run lint:lines` for strict line-budget checks (or `pnpm run lint:lines:guard` for CI-compatible guard mode)
- Run `pnpm test`
- Run `pnpm test:e2e:serial` for changes that may affect demos, dev server flow, HMR, or root Playwright E2E coverage
- Add a release intent with `pnpm change` when publishable packages change, and review `pnpm exec repo release plan`

## Repository Maintenance

- `pnpm exec repo doctor` inspects the workspace and its tooling configuration.
- `pnpm exec repo check --dry-run` previews the checks; `pnpm exec repo check` runs them.
- `pnpm exec repo clean` deletes selected workspace package directories. Use it only when intentionally removing those packages and review the selection before confirming.
- See [Dependency Security Maintenance](docs/maintenance/dependency-security.md) for security overrides, remaining advisories, and recheck commands.

## Release Workflow

Release intents remain Markdown files under `.changeset/`, created with `pnpm change`. pnpm 12 handles versioning and stores changelogs in the repository; repoctl manages release preparation and publishing.

1. Describe the affected packages and bump levels with `pnpm change`.
2. Review the pending release with `pnpm exec repo release plan`.
3. Run `pnpm run release:check` before releasing.
4. Let the release workflow prepare and publish the release, or use `pnpm exec repo release stable publish` for an intentional manual stable release.

Prereleases use a manual workflow dispatch so npm trusted publishing identifies the prepared version commit. On the matching `alpha`, `beta`, `rc`, or `next` branch, enter its lane with `pnpm exec repo release pre enter alpha` (replace `alpha` as needed), add intents with `pnpm change`, and commit the lane and intent changes. Review `pnpm exec repo release plan`, run `pnpm run release:check`, then run `pnpm version -r` locally. Commit and push the generated version, changelog, and release-ledger changes before dispatching the Release workflow on that branch with `mode=auto`. The workflow rejects pending prerelease intents because repoctl 5.7.1 changes the source commit during automatic preparation, which conflicts with the running workflow's OIDC identity. Exit the lane with `pnpm exec repo release pre exit` when returning to stable releases.

Dependency maintenance should leave package versions and release intents pending for the release workflow.

### Release checkpoint recovery

The `repoctl-release-state` branch stores durable publishing checkpoints. Its initial commit contains only checkpoint documentation, with no source-tree parent or workflow files. Each checkpoint retains the original package source commit separately. A version commit can predate workflow fixes, so initializing this branch from that commit can require workflow permissions unavailable to `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

The version-scoped pnpm patch in `patches/@icebreakers__monorepo@5.7.1.patch` fixes initialization and preserves the original branch-creation error when no concurrent publisher created the branch. `pnpm run test:release-tools` exercises the installed repoctl client with a simulated GitHub API, including concurrent creation and checkpoint conflicts. Keep these tests when upgrading repoctl; remove the patch once the upstream implementation passes them.

New releases explicitly use the workflow's checked-out commit as `REPO_RELEASE_SOURCE_SHA`, keeping checkpoint targets, npm `gitHead`, tags, and provenance aligned even when workflow fixes follow the version commit.

After a failed release, inspect the preserved `npm-publish-progress` artifact, the state branch, and npm before retrying. If no durable checkpoint or published version exists, dispatch Release with `mode=publish` on the corrected `main` without `source-sha`; the unchanged versions are built and published from that run's commit. Preserve existing versions and intents. If publication already began, preserve its checkpoint and source identity instead of starting a fresh release. Use `repo release plan` for a read-only preview.

The OIDC workflow rejects a `source-sha` different from its run commit: npm verifies the provenance source against the signed workflow identity. Resume a checkpoint from its original run; use `mode=reconcile` without a source override when only GitHub metadata is missing after npm publication. Do not override `GITHUB_SHA` or move release tags to repair a failed run.

## Line Budget Guard

`scripts/lint-lines.mjs` checks non-comment source lines in `packages/*/src` and currently uses a `300`-line budget per file.

- `pnpm run lint:lines` runs in fail-fast mode (`--mode=error`)
- `pnpm run lint:lines:warn` reports oversized files without failing
- `pnpm run lint:lines:guard` warns for files above `300` lines and fails for files above `500` lines

CI currently uses guard mode to keep existing hotspots visible while still blocking extreme file growth. For new or heavily touched files, prefer extracting reusable helpers/components to keep files under the budget.

## Migration Guards

The repository enforces the post-migration constraints in `scripts/check-migration-guards.mjs`.

The guard blocks:

- Reintroducing `@mokup/shared/esbuild`
- Direct `esbuild` imports in repository code or config
- Reintroducing `tsup`, `unbuild`, or `build.config.*` in active code/config
- Published library packages drifting away from:
  - `type: "module"`
  - `engines.node: "^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0"`
  - `build: "tsdown"`
  - `dev: "tsdown --watch"`
  - ESM-only `exports`

If you intentionally change these rules, update the guard script, its tests, and the migration docs in the same PR.
