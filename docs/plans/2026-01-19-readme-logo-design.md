# README + Logo Refresh Design

## Goals

- Provide a friendly, polished README introduction that points to the website.
- Highlight Mokup's core value quickly (file-based routing + Hono handlers).
- Add a cute pastel mascot SVG logo that works well on light backgrounds.

## Non-Goals

- Deep API documentation or configuration details.
- Branding guidelines beyond a single logo asset.

## README Layout

- Hero block with centered logo, project name, and one-sentence positioning.
- Inline links to the website (`http://mokup.icebreaker.top/`), playground, and GitHub.
- Short "Why mokup" list with 3-4 concrete product benefits:
  - File-based routing via filename suffixes.
  - JSON/JSONC and TS/JS handler support (Hono Context).
  - Vite dev + CLI build + runtime adapters.
  - Built-in headers, status, delays, middleware.
- Minimal "Quick start" showing file-based mock usage in two lines.
- Keep existing Contributing/License sections, but concise.

## Logo Direction

- Style: cute pastel mascot, soft cloud with tiny face and a spark accent.
- Palette: pastel pink and blue gradient for the cloud, warm yellow/pink spark.
- Shape: overlapping circles + rounded base for a cloud silhouette.
- Expression: simple eyes, a small smile, and light blush for approachability.
- Format: SVG for crisp scaling in README and docs.

## Deliverables

- `README.md` rewritten to the new structure.
- SVG logo at `docs/assets/mokup-logo.svg`.
