English | [Chinese](./README.zh-CN.md)

## Overview

Mokup provides file-based mock routing, a Vite plugin, and a playground UI to help you build and debug API mocks locally. For detailed usage, see https://mokup.icebreaker.top.

## Diagnostics

Mokup supports strict diagnostics through `errorOn`, so invalid routes,
duplicate routes, missing handlers, and service worker config conflicts can
fail builds or startup instead of only printing warnings.
