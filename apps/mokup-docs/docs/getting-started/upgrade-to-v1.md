## 1. Node.js requirement

All published packages now require:

```text
^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0
```

Earlier Node.js versions are no longer supported.

Development, builds, and CI for this repository use Node.js 24 LTS (at least 24.15.0 within the 24.x line) and pnpm 12.8.1. This development requirement is separate from the published packages' runtime range above.

## 2. Packages are now ESM-only

All published packages now ship ESM output only.

This CommonJS usage is no longer supported:

```js
const mokup = require('mokup')
```

Use ESM instead:

```ts
import mokup from 'mokup'
```

## 3. `@mokup/shared/esbuild` has been removed

Old entry:

```ts
import { build } from '@mokup/shared/esbuild'
```

must now be replaced with:

```ts
import { build } from '@mokup/shared/rolldown'
```

The repository now uses `@mokup/shared/rolldown` directly, backed by Rolldown.

## 4. Build tooling changed to `tsdown`

Published packages have been migrated from `unbuild` / `tsup` to `tsdown`.

If you extend package build configuration inside this monorepo, prefer:

- `tsdown.config.ts`
- `tsdown --watch`

instead of old `build.config.ts`, `tsup`, or `unbuild` setups.

## 5. Upgrade checklist

- Ensure CI, Docker, and deployment environments use a supported Node.js version
- Replace any CommonJS `require()` usage of published packages
- Replace any old `@mokup/shared/esbuild` imports
- Remove old package build scripts or `build.config.ts` files

## 6. Current repository status

This repository has already completed the migration:

- Published packages are ESM-only
- Published packages build with `tsdown`
- The build toolchain uses stable Rolldown releases
- Shared repository tooling uses repoctl; pnpm 12 native versioning consumes release intents created with `pnpm change`
- Release checks cover unit tests, type tests, and e2e tests

Preview pending releases with `pnpm exec repo release plan`. Maintainers publish stable releases through `pnpm exec repo release stable publish` after the release checks pass.
