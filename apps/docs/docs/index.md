## Build APIs the same way in dev and production

Mokup is a file-based HTTP framework that keeps routing, runtime, and adapters in one flow. Start with mocks for speed, then evolve handlers into real endpoints without changing the file structure.

It runs in Vite dev, Node middleware, and Workers so your API stays consistent across environments.
